The level of pollution has increased with times by lot of factors like the increase in population, increased vehicle use, industrialization and urbanization which results in harmful effects on human wellbeing by directly affecting health of population exposed to it. In order to monitor in this project we are going to make an IoT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System in which we will monitor the Air Quality over a web cloud using internet and will monitoring continues the air quality goes down beyond a certain level, means when there are sufficient amount of harmful gases are present in the air like Temperature, CO and LPG. It will show the air quality in PPM on the LCD and as well as on webpage so that we can monitor it very easily. In this IoT project, to monitor the air quality it will measure the harmful gases that are present in air. In which air quality can be measured from anywhere using mobile or computer.
